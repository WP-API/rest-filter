WP REST Filter restores the `filter` argument for any post endpoint on WordPress websites, since its removal in WordPress 4.7.
 
== Description ==
 
The `filter` argument in WP REST API allows the posts to be filtered using `WP_Query` public query vars. 

Since WordPress 4.7 the `filter` argument for any post endpoint was removed. 

This plugin restores the `filter` parameter for websites that were previously using it.

= Usage =

Use the `filter` parameter on any Post, or Custom Post Type endpoint such as `/wp/v2/posts` or `/wp/v2/cpt` as an array of `WP_Query`
argument. ACF values are also supported. 

Default Post:
```
fetch( 'https://domain.com/wp-json/acf/v3/post?filter[meta_key]=acfkey&filter[meta_value]=acfvalue');
```

Custom Post Type
```
// fetch( 'https://domain.com/wp-json/acf/v3/customposttype?filter[meta_key]=acfkey&filter[meta_value]=acfvalue');
fetch( 'https://domain.com/wp-json/acf/v3/ads?filter[meta_key]=currency&filter[meta_value]=AUD'); // here 'ads' is the endpoint for CPT
```

 
== Installation ==
  
1. Upload `wp-api-filter.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Why do I need WP REST Filter? =
 
If you're planning on using your WordPress website as a Backend, and you're consuming RESTful api, you'll most probably need to filter results on your GET request. This is precisely what this plugin does.

= Can I Use this plugin to find posts by tags/categories? =

Yes, however this is natively supported by WordPress 4.7+. This plugin is not necessary if you¡¯re looking to find posts by tags/categories.
